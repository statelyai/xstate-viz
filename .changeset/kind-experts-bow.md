Added more keyboard interactions to the canvas:

- arrows (<kbd>↑</kbd><kbd>↓</kbd><kbd>→</kbd><kbd>←</kbd>) can be used to move the canvas around (with <kbd>Shift</kbd> the step move is increased)
- <kbd>+</kbd>/<kbd>-</kbd> can be used to zoom in/out
- <kbd>Shift</kbd> + <kbd>1</kbd> can be used to fit the machine on the canvas
